Blokus is a wonderful game that develops logic and spatial perception while kids learn to be tactical.

Players take turns placing pieces on their board, each starting from their corner.
Each new piece must touch at least one other piece of the same color, but only at the corners.

The goal is to get rid of all your pieces.
The game is over when all players are blocked from laying down any more of their pieces.

Blokus was designed after the original idea by Bernard Tavitian.
